# Responsive table
This repo is a playground for responsive tables

## Why?
To avoid the need of a desktop and a mobile view for software that is data heavy.

## How?
This repo uses a technique where columns become rows when window gets smaller. I tried to make it a bit more flexible by provide table classes for number of columns.
