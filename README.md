# Responsive table
This repo is a playground for responsive tables

## Why?
To avoid the need of a desktop and a mobile view for software that is data heavy.

## How?
This repo uses a technique where columns become rows when window gets smaller. I tried to make it a bit more flexible by provide table classes for number of columns.

## Credits
This project is derived from https://codepen.io/geoffyuen/pen/FCBEg. Thank you very much for the idea.

**BTW:** This even works in IE11.
